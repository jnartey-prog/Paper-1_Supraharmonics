D) Notes (optional)
•	Key assumptions (model validity): LTI small-signal superposition in 2–150 kHz; quasi-stationary analysis window; point-process deployment (PPP baseline); i.i.d. electrical marks with explicit phase-asynchrony model; deterministic (or class-conditioned) propagation kernel with integrability/attenuation ensuring finite moments; per-frequency analysis with no cross-frequency coupling.
•	Missing inputs needed for best results (what to measure or specify):
1.	Empirical emission magnitude distributions per charger class and operating state (by frequency bin).
2.	Phase/asynchrony characterisation (or a justified coherence-factor range).
3.	Small-signal input admittance distributions (or class-level deterministic admittance).
4.	Transfer-impedance kernel vs electrical distance (or feeder-archetype kernels) across 2–150 kHz.
5.	Spatial deployment prior: service-region geometry, intensity (active density), and whether clustering/inhomogeneity is expected (public hubs, multi-dwelling, etc.).
